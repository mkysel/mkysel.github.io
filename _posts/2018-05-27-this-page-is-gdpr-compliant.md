## Important Stuff

I haven't posted in some period of time and I think that the time has finally come to,... \*drum roll\*... talk about something important.

I am proud to announce that Martinkysel.com is GDPR compliant. I know you are intrigued so let us examine how I managed this:

### What is GDPR?

The goal of GDPR is to protect user’s personally identifying information (PII) and hold businesses to a higher standard when it comes to how they collect, store, and use this data.

[Article 4](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/reform/files/regulation_oj_en.pdf#page=33) states that _personal data_ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’)”.

> "... an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location number, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person."

### What does this page store?

Nothing. Wicked cool, right?

### Moral of the story

Don't store data you don't need.
