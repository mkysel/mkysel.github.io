def isPiSong(s):
    for idx, word in enumerate(s):
        if len(word) != PI[idx]:
            return False    
    return True
    
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = input()
    for _ in range(t):
    	s = raw_input().split()
        if isPiSong(s):
            print "It's a pi song."
        else:
            print "It's not a pi song."
