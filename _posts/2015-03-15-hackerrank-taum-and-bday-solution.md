##### Short Problem Definition:

##### Complexity:

time complexity is O(1)

space complexity is O(1)

##### Execution:

The cost for each present is either the cost of its category, or the cost of the other category + theÂ conversion cost. Just select the minimum.

##### Solution:

```python

#!/usr/bin/py
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = input()
    for _ in xrange(t):
        b, w = map(int, raw_input().split())
        x, y, z = map(int, raw_input().split())
        
        print min(b*x, b*(y+z)) + min(w*(x+z), w*y)
```
