Welcome to my little part of the web.
The story of this blog started when I realized that I have a lot of opinions on many things, but I lack a medium to do so.
So in 2013 I created this blog.
Shorty afterwards, Iâ€™ve run out of things to say.

The big change came after I wrote the post about Competitive programming.
I started solving challenges all around the web and it quickly became the main topic of this blog.
From time to time, I express my opinion on other things.

And what about me?
I wrote my first program at a really young age.
I was too lazy to generate DnD characters by hand, so I created a `PASCAL` program to do that for me.
Since then, I never stopped.

I have a tendency to move to a different city every couple of years.
Currently, I live the famed digital nomad lifestyle (technically I am an overlanding nomad).
